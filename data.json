But how does a disciple look like? How do we know whether we have hit the mark?",

          "4. Feet (relationships)."

        "While these are four different aspects, they are also very much integrated. In this regard, we seek to develop each aspect in a holistic manner. We encourage our believers to be taking personal ownership of their spiritual formation and growth and the church seeks to work alongside the disciple to provide the community and the resources for such nurturing.",
        "Of course, each of us is at different stages of our spiritual formation. Some of us are new disciples, while others are maturing disciples. Although we know we will never become fully mature on this side of heaven, it is still our goal – to be fully mature disciples of Jesus."

    {
      "How does a maturing disciple look like?": [
        "A maturing or growing disciple is someone who is a follower of Jesus Christ and who is keen about his spiritual well-being or spiritual formation. Spiritual formation is a lifelong process of becoming more like Christ, reflecting more and more of his image in every aspect of our lives.  Jonathan Edwards, the great eighteenth-century Puritan preacher and leader of the Great Awakening, did a weekly self-check, summing up how he was doing and seeking God’s help in the process of a growing number of personal resolutions. At the age of seventeen he penned twenty-one resolutions by which he would live his life. While it doesn’t take twenty-one resolutions for us to live a spiritually transformed life, it certainly requires that we resolve to daily attend to the state of our souls.",
        "How do we know that we are indeed growing as disciples? Well, growing disciples are fundamentally marked by a deep desire to: i) love God; and ii) love others (believers and pre-believers). In turn these are evidenced by the fruit one produces in one’s life (such as a godly character; God-honouring lifestyles and relationships, winsome demeanour, etc). ",
        "In order to produce such fruit, one is totally dependent on the Holy Spirit. Yet at the same time, one needs to cultivate suitable spiritual disciplines and practices so as to allow the Spirit to undertake His transformative work. Some specific characteristics of a disciple include:",
